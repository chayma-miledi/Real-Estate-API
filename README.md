# Real-Estate-API

My final Project for the **IT325 Web Services** course this semester consists of a RESTful API developed using **Python Flask**. 
* The resources were stored thanks to the implementation of **SQLite**.
* I have also used technologies such as **Insomnia**, **VSCode**, and **Git-Version Control** to maximize the project's quality.
* This project contains all the **CRUD** Operations, secured with **JWT** token authentication.
* Multiple Insomnia Snippets were also used in order to test this project's efficiency.

This projects aim is to facilitate the information sharing of the Tunisian real estate data in a secure manner.
Its main function is returning a desired property details to someone who wishes to rent/buy a property and is clueless about the Tunisian public real estate system. \\
The API has been developed with a focus on functionality, scalability, and security, making it an ideal solution for managing real estate listings.  \\ 
This report will delve into the specific technologies used, and how they were implemented to deliver a robust and user-friendly API.
